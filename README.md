# Ice Cream Trends Analysis Using Computer Vision üç¶üìä

This project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze ice cream sales trends by detecting and counting ice cream scoops, identifying their colors, and logging data for trend analysis. The goal is to understand consumer preferences and optimize business strategies based on data-driven insights.

## Overview

Using YOLOv5 for object detection, OpenCV for image processing, and PyTorch for model deployment, this project processes images and videos to detect faces, count ice cream scoops, and identify scoop colors.

## Features

- Detects and counts the number of humans and ice cream scoops in images/videos.
- Identifies the colors of ice cream scoops.
- Logs data for trend analysis to understand consumer preferences.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ice-cream-trends.git
   cd ice-cream-trends
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the YOLOv5 weights:**

   Download the pre-trained YOLOv5 weights and place them in the `weights` directory.

## Usage

To run the detection script, use the following command:

```bash
python detect.py --source data/images --weights weights/best.pt --img-size 640 --conf-thres 0.4 --iou-thres 0.45 --device 0 --save-txt --save-conf
```

For additional options, refer to the argparse parameters in `detect.py`.

## Methodology

1. **Model Training:** Utilized YOLOv5 to train a model for detecting humans and ice cream scoops.
2. **Image Processing:** Processed images and videos to detect and classify objects.
3. **Data Logging:** Recorded the counts and colors of ice cream scoops along with the number of people in each image/video frame.
4. **Analysis:** Analyzed the collected data to identify trends in ice cream preferences by color.

## Results

- Successfully detected and counted the number of people and ice cream scoops in various settings.
- Analyzed which colors of ice cream were most popular among consumers.
- Provided insights into consumer preferences and potential trends in ice cream sales.

## Future Work

- Further refine the model for increased accuracy.
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse images and videos.
- Explore real-time deployment in retail environments for instant insights.
